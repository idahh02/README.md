# TITLE OF THE PROJECT 

  Blood Bank Web Application

## INTRODUCTION

  In a world where medical emergencies, accidents, and surgeries are an unavoidable part of life, access to a robust and efficient blood donation system is critical. 
  The importance of timely and secure blood donations cannot be overstated, as countless lives depend on this precious resource. Recognizing the vital role that technology 
  plays in enhancing healthcare services, we present our proposal for the development of Blood Bank Web Application. This innovative web application is designed to address 
  the challenges faced by traditional blood banks, streamline the donation process, and ultimately save more lives.Our proposal encompasses a comprehensive approach, integrating 
  cutting-edge technologies to create a user-friendly platform that encourages blood donation, facilitates efficient inventory management, and provides immediate access to 
  blood supplies when and where they are needed the most.

## OBJECTIVE

  The objective of Blood Bank Web Application is to develop an efficient donor management in the healthcare service. This web application encompasses a comprehensive system that seamless   integrates with healthcare institutions to facilitate efficient collection, processing, storage, and distribution processes. Futhermore, this Bank Blood Web Application also implement    the features for real-time tracking of blood products, minimizing delays and ensuring timely responses to healthcare professionals blood requests.

## FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

By using Blood Bank Web Application, the operation of blood donation and blood supplies is paperless. The donors and blood donation centres can communicate efficiently and coordinate with each other to minimize time and effort required for blood donation process. This system helps donors to donate their blood by fill in the form that provided first. It also allows the recipients to request for blood easily. This system will store all the donor and recipient information that consist of their ID, donor and recipient names, gender, date of birth, phone number and blood type to the system database.
